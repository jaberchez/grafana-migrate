  # List of folders. You can set a list of names or "all". If
  # you set "all" the rest is ignored
  folders:
    - 'all'

  # the name of the folder which dashboard belongs to
  dashboards:
    # If we set "all", we don't need to provide the folder. Every
    # dashboard will be stored in its own folder
    # Notice: - If you set "all", the rest of the list is ignored

    #           you can choose if you want to overwrite it (default false)
    - name: all
      overwrite: false

    # We need to provide the folder which dashboard belongs because
    # you can have multiple dashboards with the same name in diferents
    # folders, so we need to know the right dashboard you want to migrate
    #- name: Test
    #  folder: "Folder_1"
    #  overwrite: false

  # List of datasources to migrate. You can configure name "all" or
  # a list of them. If you set "all" the rest is ignored

  # For users it is the same explanation as in the folders
  # Notice: The list is the login field
